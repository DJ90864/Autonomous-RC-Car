# Autonomous-RC-Car

It's not actually a RC car since it doesn't have a remote controller or transmitter. I made it using two ultrasound sensors (front and back) placed on top of servo motors to turn them in different directions to detect obstacles and figure out a drive process autonomusly. I used an arduino mega and a ADAfruit shield on top of it to run 4 motors using two L298N ICs. 
I 3D printed the car parts like tyres, exterior, stands for ultrasonic sensors etc.
